[Portfolio Maker](https://bs-portfolio-maker.netlify.app)

By Using The Website, you can create beautiful portfolios without coding a single line. This is only a demo version of what will come. 

## What you can do with this website?

You can create components like Navigation Bar, Header, Footer, Cards, Accordions, Carousel (Image Slideshow) and others...

## How to use them?

It's easy. You can simply tap the get started button from the landing page and it will take you to another page where you will see a large button named "Add Component". Then, tap that button and it will let you choose which component you would like to add first. Each Component creation page has their own preview. So that you will know exactly what you're doing in real time. If you're satisfy with your editing, tap 'Create Component' button and it will take back add component page. And you will see your component is showed at the top of the page. Remeber! We still not support layer rearrangement function. So, you can't change the order of components. But you can delete unwanted components. You can also change the background color of your website.

## After that, what should I do?

You can simply tap "Layer menu" from the bottom right corner of the "Add Component" page. You will see a button name "Download your website". Click that button and It will download an HTML file to your system. Vola, that's your website. You can do whatever you want with that. You can host it in netlify which we highly recommend to use. You can host your website online free with that.
